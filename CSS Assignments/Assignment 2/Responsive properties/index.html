      <h1>Demo specifying the difference between rem,em,vh,vw,px.</h1>
    </header>

    <div id="container">
      <h2 class="res">1. rem-</h2>
      <p id="detail">
        Font-size gets set according to the font-size of the root element.In
        general the html is the root element. In rem "r" stands for root.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <h2 id="box1" class="bx">This is first sentence</h2>
        <h2 id="box2" class="bx">This is second sentence</h2>
        <h2 id="box3" class="bx">This is third sentence</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        "In the browser, you can see that the font size of the first heading has
        changed from 10px to 40px because 4rem is equal to 4 times the root
        element."
      </p>

      <h2 class="res">2. em-</h2>
      <p id="detail">
        Font-sizes are inherited relative to the parent element. 10em means ten
        times of the parent element.
      </p>
      <div class="boxes">
        <h2 id="box4" class="bx1">This is first sentence</h2>
        <h2 id="box5" class="bx1">This is second sentence</h2>
        <h2 id="box6" class="bx1">This is third sentence</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        "In the browser, you can see that the font-size of the second heading is
        changed. Earlier the font-size was 10px because box5 inherited this size
        from its parent element, i.e., boxes. Now, the font-size of box5 has
        changed to 40px because 4em means four times of the parent element so
        4*10=40px."
      </p>

      <h2 class="res">3. vh-</h2>
      <p id="detail">
        It stands for viewport height. vh is equal to the 1/100 times of the
        viewport height. Example: Suppose height of the browser is 1000px, so
        1vh is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px.
      </p>
      <div class="boxes1">
        <h2 id="box7" class="bx2">This is first sentence</h2>
        <h2 id="box8" class="bx2">This is second sentence</h2>
        <h2 id="box9" class="bx2">This is third sentence</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        "100vh takes the entire height of the viewport. Benefit of this is that
        you don't need to calculate the pixel that will be required to cover the
        entire viewport or height of the the screen"
      </p>

      <h2 class="res">4. vw-</h2>
      <p id="detail">
        It stands for viewport width. Similar to vh, vw is equal to the 1/100
        times of the viewport width. Example: Suppose width of the browser is
        1000px, so 1vw is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px.
      </p>
      <div class="boxes2">
        <h2 id="box10" class="bx3">This is first sentence</h2>
        <h2 id="box11" class="bx3">This is second sentence</h2>
        <h2 id="box12" class="bx3">This is third sentence</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        "100vw used here, you can see that the border's width is changed to 100%
        of the viewport."
      </p>

      <h2 class="res">4. px-</h2>
      <p id="detail">
        The px stands for pixels. This is mostly designed for CSS and it is one
        of the most used absolute length. Although it comes under absolute
        lengths itâ€™s length vary relative to the device types and that is the
        reason, even W3C recommends to use the pixel unit for display screen.
