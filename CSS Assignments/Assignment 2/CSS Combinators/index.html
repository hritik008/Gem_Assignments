      <h3 class="com">1. Descendant Selector(space) :</h3>
      <p id="detail">
        A descendant selector in CSS is any selector with white space between
        two selectors without a combinator specified in between. example: div p,
        here all the paragraph under div can be styled at once.

        <h2 id="box2" class="bx">This is second sentence</h2>
        <h2 id="box3" class="bx">This is third sentence</h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        The first sentence size is changed using descendant selector, here i
        selected the sentence inside the box class using id of the sentence
        separated by space
      </p>

      <h3 class="com">2. Child Selector(>) :</h3>
      <p id="detail">
        Child Selector is used to match all the elements which are child of a
        specified element. It gives the relation between two elements. The
        element > element selector selects those elements which are the children
        of specific parent.

      <h3 class="com">3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+) :</h3>
      <p id="detail">
        It uses the plus (+) sign as the separator between the elements. It
        matches the second element only when the element immediately follows the
        first element, and both of them are the children of the same parent.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <h2 class="bx">This is first sentence</h2>

        selector, here i selected the h2 element which is after div as the css
        to modify, using the div element and the id of the sentence separated by
        "+".
      </p>

      <h3 class="com">4. General Sibling Selector (~) :</h3>
      <p id="detail">
        The general sibling combinator (~) separates two selectors and matches
        all iterations of the second element, that are following the first
        element, and are children of the same parent element.
      </p>
      <div class="box">
        <h2 class="bx">This is first sentence</h2>
      </div>

        general sibling selector, here i selected the h2 element which is after
        div as the css to modify, using the div element and the id of the
        sentence separated by "~".
